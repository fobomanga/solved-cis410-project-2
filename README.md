Assignment:1) Download skeleton file proj2.cxx and file data_proj2.vtk and put them in anew directory.2) Re-use your from CMakeLists.txt … copy it to a new directory and rename“proj1” to be “proj2”.3) Compile the program and run the program. It will generate incorrect output.4) You will need to implement three functions to make it generate the correctoutput (search for “IMPLEMENT ME!”)a. I would recommend you implement them in the following order:i. BoundingBoxForCellii. CountNumberOfStraddlingCellsiii. EvaluateFieldAtLocation5) Compare the output with the output I posted. Keep in mind that not allfunction invocations have valid arguments. GetBoundingBox returns [-100-&gt;+100, -100-&gt;+100] for invalid cell indices and EvaluateFieldAtLocationreturns 0 for invalid locations.6) Upload your source code when it is working.If it does not produce the correct answer, then you should expect to get less thanhalf credit. I would prefer to get working code late than non-working code on time
